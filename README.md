# Computer Vision Notebooks Collection

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on computer vision tasks. In this repository, you'll find notebooks covering a wide range of topics, including image classification, face recognition, and more. We'll explore various deep learning architectures and techniques to tackle these exciting computer vision challenges.

## What's Inside?

This repository is a treasure trove of computer vision knowledge. You'll discover:

- Implementations of popular architectures like VGG, ResNet, and more for image classification.
- Notebooks dedicated to face recognition using state-of-the-art techniques.
- Experiments with object detection, semantic segmentation, and other vision tasks.
- Tutorials on data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation.
- Real-world applications and case studies showcasing the power of computer vision.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended).
- Jupyter Notebook installed (if not, you can install it with pip).
- Required libraries like PyTorch, Transformers which are in the requirements.txt file.
- A curious mind and a passion for computer vision!

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zucchini-nlp/computer-vision
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your favorite environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).
3. Follow along with the notebook's instructions and code blocks.
4. Experiment, tweak, and modify the code to see how different changes affect the model's performance.
5. Have fun and learn!
