### <a name="classification">Image Classification</a>

Image classification is a fundamental computer vision task that involves training machines to recognize and categorize objects or patterns within images. This capability is at the core of various applications, from identifying objects in photos to enabling self-driving cars to detect road signs and pedestrians.

**Loss and Accuracy**

The loss function is used to measure how well the model's predictions match the ground truth labels. The accuracy metric is used to measure how often the model's predictions are correct. For image classification, a common loss function is the cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the ground truth class probabilities. The accuracy metric for image classification is typically calculated as the percentage of images that are correctly classified by the model.

**Popular Architectures**

There are a variety of different image classification architectures available. Some of the most popular architectures include:

* Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
* Vision transformers (ViTs)

CNNs are a type of neural network that is well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs learn to extract features from images that are relevant for classification.

ViTs are a newer type of neural network that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification benchmarks. ViTs work by converting images into a sequence of tokens and then using a transformer architecture to learn representations of the tokens.

**Choosing an Architecture**

The best image classification architecture for a particular task will depend on the specific requirements of the task, such as the desired accuracy, speed, and resource constraints.

If accuracy is the most important factor, then a ViT-based model is a good choice. If speed is the most important factor, then a CNN-based model is a good choice. If resource constraints are a concern, then a smaller CNN-based model may be a better choice.

**Explore the Notebooks**

In this repository, I've provided three notebooks, each offering a unique approach to image classification. These notebooks serve as practical examples to help you grasp the concepts and gain hands-on experience in image classification. You'll find demonstrations using different architectures and libraries, allowing you to explore various techniques and methodologies. Here's a quick overview of the three notebooks available:

1. **Notebook 1: VGG from Scratch on CIFAR100 with PyTorch** - This notebook guides you through the process of building a VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model from scratch using the PyTorch framework. You'll apply this model to the CIFAR-100 dataset, gaining hands-on experience in creating a deep neural network for image classification. Explore this notebook if you're interested in building neural networks from the ground up.

2. **Notebook 2: ResNet from Scratch with PyTorch Lightning** - In this notebook, you'll explore the construction of a ResNet model from scratch using PyTorch Lightning. ResNet is a popular architecture known for its deep network design. You'll learn how to implement and train this model for image classification tasks. If you're curious about building and training deep convolutional networks, this notebook is for you.

3. **Notebook 3: Fine-tuning Vision Transformer (ViT) with Hugging Face Trainer** - The third notebook takes a different approach by introducing the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. You'll utilize the Hugging Face Trainer framework to fine-tune a pre-trained ViT model for image classification, showcasing the power of transfer learning. This notebook is perfect for those interested in leveraging pre-trained models for image classification tasks.


### <a name="detection">Object Detection</a>

Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within images or video frames. Unlike image classification, where the goal is to assign a single label to an entire image, object detection goes a step further by not only recognizing objects but also providing their precise positions within the scene.

Why do we need object detection? It's because real-world applications demand a deeper understanding of visual content. Object detection plays a pivotal role in a wide range of fields, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance, medical imaging, robotics, and retail. Here are a few reasons why object detection is indispensable:

* Localization: Object detection provides information about where objects are located within an image or video stream. This capability is crucial for tasks such as self-driving cars identifying pedestrians or surgeons locating anomalies in medical images.*
* Classification: Beyond localization, object detection assigns class labels to objects. This enables systems to not only detect, for example, a dog in an image but also categorize it as a specific breed.
* Tracking: Object detection is used for tracking objects over time, making it essential in applications like video surveillance, sports analytics, and augmented reality.
* Safety and Security: In security and surveillance systems, object detection can detect unauthorized intruders, suspicious objects, or potential threats.
* Automation: Industrial robots, drones, and automated quality control systems rely on object detection to navigate and interact with their environments effectively.

**Popular Architectures:**
Several popular architectures have emerged in the field of object detection, each with its own strengths and characteristics. Some of the most renowned architectures include Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector). These architectures differ in terms of speed, accuracy, and complexity, making it crucial to choose one that aligns with your specific project requirements.

Selecting the right architecture for your object detection task is a critical decision. Factors to consider include the complexity of the dataset, the speed requirements for real-time processing, and the available computational resources. Understanding the strengths and limitations of different architectures is key to making an informed choice.

**Explore the Notebooks:**
There is a Jupyter notebook that will guides you through the process of training and fine-tuning a Fast R-CNN model for object detection on the CPPE-5 dataset. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and explanations to help you grasp the concepts and apply them to your own projects. Make the most of these resources to enhance your understanding of object detection with Fast R-CNN.



### <a name="recognition">Face Recognition</a>

Face recognition is a specialized field within computer vision that involves identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features. It's a crucial component of biometric security systems and has a wide range of applications, from unlocking your smartphone to enhancing surveillance and access control.

**Notebook Highlights: Face Recognition with ResNet from Scratch**

- **Dataset:** The notebook utilizes the "Labelled Faces in the Wild" dataset, a collection of diverse labeled face images. This dataset provides a rich resource for training and evaluating your face recognition model with real-world face data.

- **Model:** You'll learn how to construct a ResNet-based face recognition model from scratch. ResNet is renowned for its deep network design, making it well-suited for the complex task of recognizing faces in varying conditions.

- **Loss Functions:** The notebook explains two crucial loss functions: Triplet Loss and Contrastive Loss. These functions play a pivotal role in training an effective face recognition model. Triplet Loss encourages the model to reduce the distance between embeddings of matching faces while increasing the distance between non-matching faces, and Contrastive Loss enforces a similar concept.

### <a name="captioning">Image Captioning</a>

Image captioning is a captivating realm where the visual meets the textual. It's a task that bridges the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. In image captioning, the goal is to generate human-like descriptions or captions for images, allowing machines to understand and communicate the content of visual data. It's a journey into the art of storytelling through pixels.
